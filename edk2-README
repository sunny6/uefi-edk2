TianoCore Development kit
        1. git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git
        2. cd edk2
        3. make -C BaseTools
        4. ./edksetup.sh
        5. setup path for build and Trim 
                export PATH=$PATH:/home/devbox/efi-work/tools/edk2/BaseTools/BinWrappers/PosixLike/
        6. Setup build target :-
                edit Conf/target.txt
                
                Find

                        ACTIVE_PLATFORM       = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc

                and replace it with

                        ACTIVE_PLATFORM       = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc OR the module directory you like to build like DuetPkg/DuetPkg64.dsc

                Find

                        TOOL_CHAIN_TAG        = MYTOOLS 

                and replace it with GCC version

                        TOOL_CHAIN_TAG        = GCC49 

                Find

                        TARGET_ARCH           = IA32 

                and replace it with 'X64' for 64bit or 'IA32 X64' to build both architectures.

                        TARGET_ARCH           = X64


        7. compile using build command
        8. if build fails go through error and solve it few packages may be missing like iasl, nasm etc
        9. Check my demo app attached
        10. For Building an app :-
                1. Create on folder ex SkApps
                2. Place hi.c and hi.inf files in app folder
                3. Make sure hi.inf and hi.c have corrected syntax (Net versions are old and these attached files are compiled sucessfully so ...)
                4. Make entry in dsc file for active platform (Ex Duet/DuetPkg64.dsc)
                   to the the [Components] section and before the [BuildOptions] section. 
                   (e.g. SkAaps/SkAaps.inf )
                5. Build
                6. Final Output .efi file will be in the directory WorkSpace/Build/DuetPkgX64/DEBUG_GCC49/
